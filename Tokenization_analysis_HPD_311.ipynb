    "### Analysis of NYC 311 records assigned to Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the New York City Data Portal Python API to pull in all 311 data records (from January 1, 2010 to Oct 30, 2020 - present) that were assigned to the HPD for resolution. It conducts a tokenization analysis of the resolution description found in this dataset and generates tables that can be fed into Tableau to visualize. It is organized into the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Intro**: Configuration and helpful functions\n",
    "- **Section 1**: Pulls in a sample of data from all departments to make sure that all complaints that should be assigned to HPD are in fact correctly labeled\n",
    "- **Section 2**: Pulls in all data from 2010-present assigned to HPD and performs basic cleaning\n",
    "- **Section 3**: Performs more sophisticated cleaning of the resolution_descriptions (ie. a few sentences describing the steps taken to resolve the complaint, and the outcome if completed)\n",
    "- **Section 4**: Assigns text tags to the resolution_descriptions (ie. tokenize the resolution_descriptions into important phrases that are common to all of them). This enables me to analyze the sentiment of these descriptions and better understand the HPD resolution process and citizen's experience when using 311.\n",
    "- **Section 5**: Performs logical checks on the data integrity and resolves problems (ex. ensure the timestamp that a complaint is closed falls after the timestamp of when it's open)\n",
    "-  **Section 6**: Analyzes resolution_description text_tags and exports tables that can be loaded into Tableau to generate visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "The final visualizations that this dataset produces can be viewed here:\n",
